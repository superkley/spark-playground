Its hard to directly say that the act of going over the speed limit is what causes the crashes.The US DOT did a study on data between 2005 and 2007 that found 8.4% of all crashes were because the driver was driving \"too fast for conditions\", and another 4.9% were \"too fast for curve\". (http://www.thenewspaper.com/rlc/docs/2008/us-crashcause.pdf)  Neither of which can be considered outright speeding, so the percentage of crashes due to simply going over the speed limit is even below that (a virginia study found it to be about 2.9% in their state - http://www.thenewspaper.com/rlc/docs/2008/va-crash07.pdf).  Now one could say, \"Well its more than 0% so its worth enforcing a speed limit.\"  And I agree that there needs to be some sort of limit, but it needs to be a speed which is correct for the road.  If 90% of traffic is going 15 over, would you not say the speed limit is too slow for the road?  If 90% of traffic is going 15 over, that means 10% isnt which is really the majority cause of these speed related crashes, difference of speed of those involved.  So if the majority of traffic is going over the speed limit, do we limit the majority of people and continue to write tickets to those who dont obey, or do we raise the speed limit to prevent drivers from going slower than the pack?  Well we continue to write tickets of course because its a great source of income for police departments! /s\n",

If one watched that split, Vulcun also placed third, and were beaten by TSM 2-1 in the semi's, which GGU subsequently lost to in the finals 3-2.Vulcun didn't get the luxury of a B of 5 like GGU, and their series against TSM was also fairly close, much like GGU's. Arguably the 2 teams (Coast and Vulcun) could have been = in strength. Back then I was actually of the opinion that Vulcun was better than GGU, they just had to face TSM earlier than GGU did in the bracket... I don't even remember who GGU faced in semi's, but it wasn't nearly as bad as TSM, plus, Vulcun beat Curse just to get to the semis I think.-edit Ok looking back, it's weird. Vulcun beats CLG, then beats Curse, then faces TSM in semi's... But Despite losing, Curse also plays GGU in the semis. WTF is this bracket??? GGU beats Dignitas, then beats Curse in Semi's and then faces TSM in the finals. Pretty similar paths, Vulcun had to play an extra set earlier for... reasons? wins 2 sets, then loses in a close set to TSM. GGU beats two teams in a a best of 3 then loses to TSM. Who was better? Too bad they never got a chance to play each other in the bracket, my money was on Vulcun easy. Jintae/Dude couldn't handle Mancloud/Xmithie, guarantee it.Coast also got relegated the split right after Vulcun did, at least Vulcun could say they got relegated by LMQ... Coast got relegated by Complexity! They requalified through the expansion tournament in a reverse sweep upset over Fusion that shouldn't have been possible without the legendary Maknoon tilt.

INT is the only mental stat that's noticeably more powerful than the rest.Some may argue that since CHA and WIS apply to a similar number of skills but WIS also applies to Will saves, that makes it better. I refer those people to the feat found in totally-fair-and-not-broken-ACG which gives the Oracle Divine Grace, as the Paladin ability (add CHA to all saves in addition to their base stat), so lack of this option actually makes WIS *weaker* than CHA for the Oracle's purposes.Another option is to play a Lore Shaman instead of a Lore Oracle. Aside from being WIS based out the gate, Lore Shaman gets a very good reason to grab a non-trivial INT score as well which feels appropriate here.

He constantly is getting as cut as possible and is always training and always gets backed by teammates as a hard worker.How many Hornets practices have you watched?  How many scrimmages?  How much tape?  How much have you talked to the trainers?  I'm gonna go ahead and say less than Clifford.  &gt; Being top 10 in defense doesn't mean he doesn't plays undersized line ups that lost us 4th Q leads....  I remember line ups of Kemba/Roberts/PJ/Marv/maxiell every single person is undersized in that group.  Bottom line he subbed defense for offense in the 4th and that resulted in losses.You have to deal the cards you're dealt.  We don't have a very tall team, so we're going to be playing undersized ball a lot.  I don't think the lineup you mentioned really saw that much floor time.  PJ didn't play very often.  When we did put that lineup (or variations of that lineup) on the court, it was to score points.  The team is much, much better at defense than offense.  More often than not the reasons why we lost games were due to offensive problems rather than defensive problems.  Roberts, PJ, and Marvin are all better from 3 than the other guys at their positions (or at least were before Mo came).  They're still not good, but they're the best option to put points on the board.  &gt; Cliff foolishly stuck with his guns ... while our young players matured and needed more touches which they didn't get this year1. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Clifford had no reason to go into the season with the assumption that Al would regress so much.  Had Al been healthy, the plan would have worked and we'd be in the playoffs.  2. Our team is built around Big Al on both offense and defense.  Our entire defensive strategy comes from a scheme Clifford devised to hide Al's weaknesses by focusing on team help D.  The players we signed were meant to compliment big Al (PJ, Marvin, Roberts, Mo, Lance, etc) and fit the system.  3. You can't easily change your identity mid- or late-season.  Players need time to learn new roles, new gameplans, and new schemes.  Making a radically new system is not something you can introduce overnight.  A lot of time, money, and talent is invested into the Big Al system (which has proven to be successful before).  When a tire goes flat on your car, the car naturally won't work as well as before.  That doesn't mean that you need to buy a new car, only get new tires.  We've had a lot of flats this year.4. Which young players?  MKG got more playing time and lots more touches and shots on offense than ever before.  Zeller got loads more playing time and even became the regular starter.  I'm not sure you can honestly use PJ and \"matured\" yet in the same sentence.  &gt; He actually threw MKG under the bus very hard recently and it pissed me off.  ???? Clifford said [MKG might be Hornets most important player.](https://twitter.com/rick_bonnell/status/588732257600458752)  \"[He has a contagious competitiveness about him....When he wasn't on the floor I didn't like it](https://twitter.com/rick_bonnell/status/588733044938375168).\"  [Clifford said the simplest measure of MKG's value is when he didn't play they didn't win.](https://twitter.com/rick_bonnell/status/588733213343932418)Yeah, Clifford *really* hates MKG.    /s\n",

      "5. Because you speeding does not directly result in a crash statistically.  Its hard to directly say that the act of going over the speed limit is what causes the crashes.The US DOT did a study on data between 2005 and 2007 that found 8.4% of all crashes were because the driver was driving \"too fast for conditions\", and another 4.9% were \"too fast for curve\". (http://www.thenewspaper.com/rlc/docs/2008/us-crashcause.pdf)  Neither of which can be considered outright speeding, so the percentage of crashes due to simply going over the speed limit is even below that (a virginia study found it to be about 2.9% in their state - http://www.thenewspaper.com/rlc/docs/2008/va-crash07.pdf).  Now one could say, \"Well its more than 0% so its worth enforcing a speed limit.\"  And I agree that there needs to be some sort of limit, but it needs to be a speed which is correct for the road.  If 90% of traffic is going 15 over, would you not say the speed limit is too slow for the road?  If 90% of traffic is going 15 over, that means 10% isnt which is really the majority cause of these speed related crashes, difference of speed of those involved.  So if the majority of traffic is going over the speed limit, do we limit the majority of people and continue to write tickets to those who dont obey, or do we raise the speed limit to prevent drivers from going slower than the pack?  Well we continue to write tickets of course because its a great source of income for police departments! /s\n",

      "4. Because you speeding does not directly result in a crash statistically.  Its hard to directly say that the act of going over the speed limit is what causes the crashes.The US DOT did a study on data between 2005 and 2007 that found 8.4% of all crashes were because the driver was driving \"too fast for conditions\", and another 4.9% were \"too fast for curve\". (http://www.thenewspaper.com/rlc/docs/2008/us-crashcause.pdf)  Neither of which can be considered outright speeding, so the percentage of crashes due to simply going over the speed limit is even below that (a virginia study found it to be about 2.9% in their state - http://www.thenewspaper.com/rlc/docs/2008/va-crash07.pdf).  Now one could say, \"Well its more than 0% so its worth enforcing a speed limit.\"  And I agree that there needs to be some sort of limit, but it needs to be a speed which is correct for the road.  If 90% of traffic is going 15 over, would you not say the speed limit is too slow for the road?  If 90% of traffic is going 15 over, that means 10% isnt which is really the majority cause of these speed related crashes, difference of speed of those involved.  So if the majority of traffic is going over the speed limit, do we limit the majority of people and continue to write tickets to those who dont obey, or do we raise the speed limit to prevent drivers from going slower than the pack?  Well we continue to write tickets of course because its a great source of income for police departments! /s\n",

Then the second half of this short clip was jam packed with so much *more* bullshit that I now have a novel written.  I wasn't going to post it but have [too much put into it now](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs), I might as well.* \"So the intact male needs *very* small strokes during intercourse to ride the wave to orgasm and to ejaculate.\"Um ... I'm cut, and I like both deep and shallow, but I do prefer deep.  I always thought that was just because I'm a bit bigger than average and like to actually be fully *inside*, not feeling like I'm half out.  But okay, maybe she has something there.* \"These nerve endings in the ridge band are the accelerator that allow a man to ride that wave to orgasm ... When they're cut off a man is left with an off/on switch instead of an accelerator.\"Um ... **NO ...** I'm pretty sure that's not how *mine* works.* Having these nerve endings is what allows you to learn how to modulate the experience.Um ... I can modulate the experience ...* \"So that you don't have premature ejaculations, so that you do ride the wave to orgasm ...\"Um ... I'm cut, and I definitely have experienced riding that wave ...* \"... and without them, it's impossible.\"Okay, that's **BULLSHIT.**  Who the fuck is this lady, and why am I listening to *her*, and why the fuck is this getting posted on Reddit, and why is this bullshit getting *upvoted*??* \"The biological act for the circumcised male becomes the satisfaction of an urge, not the refined sensory experience it was meant to be.\"That was written by someone 45 years ago who may or may not have had a bias.  I'm cut and I can say from personal experience it's both the satisfaction of an urge *and* a refined sensory experience. I suppose I can't comment on whether or not it's *more* refined when uncut or whether or not uncut guys sometimes simply want to satisfy an urge, but I'm not not really sure there's any way to quantify this statement at all, so why the fuck are we even discussing it?* \"When a man has been circumcised, and has lost all of those, whatever ways he's going to ejaculate he's not going to ride that wave because he has no way to get the feedback to ride the wave.\"This is clearly a case where a woman should not be trying to educate others on what it's like to be a man.  I can only imagine that how I feel right now is what it's like for women when they listen to male politicians talking about anything relating to women.* \"Which is why the number one complaint of circumcised men is premature ejaculation.\"Is it???  And even if it is, you really think the lack of the foreskin is the problem?  Not their lack of a will/desire to train themselves to hold out?  To learn where that line is, and not to cross it until they choose to?  Or lack of enough sex to allow one's self to even explore that possibility?  Has no one bothered to ask those questions?  Or done any actual study to confirm that's not the issue?* older men have to work harder, which can induce chafing Uh ... I've put on weight in the last 20 years.  I'm pretty sure I'm working harder because I'm out of shape and not as physically attractive as I used to be ... I'm sometimes turned off by the fact that sex isn't what it used to be like when I was 20.  Have you any studies you can reference?  Have they excluded other factors like these that would affect men and women who've aged?* \"Now the widest part is the corona is on the outside ... drags her juices out. He doesn't bring any of his own juices because he doesn't have them.\"(A) She makes it sound like she's not producing any more. If she's not continuing to produce fluids then there's another problem that's probably more serious than whether or not the guy's cut.  (B) She makes it sound like an uncut guy does contribute some fluids.  I've noticed I do produce fluid from my shaft (and no, I'm not talking about fluids coming out of the urethra) but it's not at any level like a woman does.  I don't know exactly what she's talking about but I don't think uncut guys produce fluid that much either.  Maybe some, but not like a woman, and not like a mouth full of saliva.  Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong.* \"With an intact man the foreskin and the labia act like rings and piston, they keep all the juices inside. So now every time he disengages he's withdrawing her lubrication.\"Are you fucking kidding me?  Really?  Have you no concept of fluids? Surface tension? None of that?  I would say an uncut man would probably withdraw *more* fluids when he withdraws completely.* \"He's departing from her body, he's no longer touching the mons pupis. She now can't ride the wave to orgasm either because it's this instead of this.\" (makes motions of clapping versus rubbing her hands)So now you're suggesting a cut male is somehow shorter in length, and this now means he can't withdraw without coming out completely?  Getthefuckouttahere.  That's complete bullshit.  Not to mention the fact some women *prefer* when a guy pulls out all the way and re-enters, but let's not even discuss that.I mean ... don't get me wrong ... if I have another son I don't plan on having him cut, but that's because I believe in personal choice, not because any of the bullshit this woman is trying to parade as science.BTW ...

Considering the subject of this TIL, and many other threads, are about men suffering from the repercussions of false rape allegations, while their false-accusers go free without anything to resemble justice, I'd say the evidence begs to differ, and that yes, these cases are about Men suffering, as a demographic that face unfair consequences when falsely accused.Let's count the ways society \"Does not fall over itself to help women\", shall we? We have Affirmative Action (Or as some call it in a solipsistic manner, \"Positive Discrimination\", as if there could be such a thing), we have the general aforementioned leniency in sentencing that you conveniently ignored, we have woman-only gyms and other \"Safe Spaces\" for women to congregate and socialize outside of interacting with men (While the same concept for men was demonized as sexist and discriminatory only a couple decades ago), and the \"Listen and Believe\" line being pushed on college campuses that has now led to a complete violation, yet again, of Title IX in their zealotry to \"Protect the Womynz\", which was done at their behest, I might add.None of these benefits are extended to men. In fact, given the statistics on [health research alone,](http://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending.aspx) with research expenditures for Breast Cancer at $715 Million, Uterine Cancer at $40 Million, and Women's Health at a whopping total of $3,891,000,000 the amount spent on any field remotely benefitting men looks like a pittance, with Prostate Cancer at $284 Million, and absolutely zilch, zip, nada for either Testicular Cancer or Men's Health. We are largely left to fend for ourselves in the private sector for our healthcare research, which if you are familiar with anything in regards to research and funding, depending on private backers only means research is agonizingly slow without public funds. When the grand total of public healthcare costs in major gender-specific health issues ($4,576,000,000 for women, versus $40,000,000 for men) do not even come down to men even getting 1% of what is spent on women's health issues, and yet you claim that \"Society does not fall over itself to help women\", it makes it perfectly clear who the ignorant one here is.Edit: Oh, wow...this is rich. I never expected somebody that let their subjectivity influence their arguments so badly would be a Teacher! I was expecting some fast-food worker or perhaps a Women's Studies major.

We don't have a very tall team, so we're going to be playing undersized ball a lot.  I don't think the lineup you mentioned really saw that much floor time.  PJ didn't play very often.  When we did put that lineup (or variations of that lineup) on the court, it was to score points.  The team is much, much better at defense than offense.  More often than not the reasons why we lost games were due to offensive problems rather than defensive problems.  Roberts, PJ, and Marvin are all better from 3 than the other guys at their positions (or at least were before Mo came).  They're still not good, but they're the best option to put points on the board.  &gt; Cliff foolishly stuck with his guns ... while our young players matured and needed more touches which they didn't get this year1. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.  Clifford had no reason to go into the season with the assumption that Al would regress so much.  Had Al been healthy, the plan would have worked and we'd be in the playoffs.  2. Our team is built around Big Al on both offense and defense.  Our entire defensive strategy comes from a scheme Clifford devised to hide Al's weaknesses by focusing on team help D.  The players we signed were meant to compliment big Al (PJ, Marvin, Roberts, Mo, Lance, etc) and fit the system.  3. You can't easily change your identity mid- or late-season.  Players need time to learn new roles, new gameplans, and new schemes.  Making a radically new system is not something you can introduce overnight.  A lot of time, money, and talent is invested into the Big Al system (which has proven to be successful before).  When a tire goes flat on your car, the car naturally won't work as well as before.  That doesn't mean that you need to buy a new car, only get new tires.  We've had a lot of flats this year.4. Which young players?  MKG got more playing time and lots more touches and shots on offense than ever before.  Zeller got loads more playing time and even became the regular starter.  I'm not sure you can honestly use PJ and \"matured\" yet in the same sentence.  &gt; He actually threw MKG under the bus very hard recently and it pissed me off.  ???? Clifford said [MKG might be Hornets most important player.](https://twitter.com/rick_bonnell/status/588732257600458752)  \"[He has a contagious competitiveness about him....When he wasn't on the floor I didn't like it](https://twitter.com/rick_bonnell/status/588733044938375168).\"  [Clifford said the simplest measure of MKG's value is when he didn't play they didn't win.](https://twitter.com/rick_bonnell/status/588733213343932418)Yeah, Clifford *really* hates MKG.    /s\n",
      "2. Belief in an afterlife hinders healthy acknowledgement of death and breeds unhealthy lust of nostalgia and regression, as you are portraying right now. /s\n",
      "3. So it breeds with them. Seems legit /s\n",
      "4. The thing is, I actually own a 13 month old husky. This is considered one of the least aggressive breeds of dogs. The only way this dog would viciously attack someone is if it was never properly trained, consistently taunted, and left outside tied to a tree to bake in the sun all day. So the guy is a piece of shit dog owner, who then freaked out when it turned on his roommate and issued a slow, painful death. No you're right, the guy did exactly what he should have done, there's just a backlash because Cary. /s\n",
      "5. This is the kind of thing that makes me want to get a pet gator.I've had reptiles and was really into herping, worked with my local zookeepers and reptile sanctuaries... I miss reptiles.I'll raise that beautiful beast right, so one day I may ride my wingless dragon into naval warfare.And hey, gators and crocs stay smaller for longer than \"small\" pig breeds. I'd make a **killing** selling \"teacup/Juliana\" crocodiles /s\n",
      "6. &gt;Nope. Unless he does something really dicky, which I don't expect him to do. Saying \"success breeds hate\" is just lazy writing. Exactly... I mean, it's not we don't all love Duncan, **Kobe**, and Dirk. /s\n",
