    "# StandardScaler\n",
    "Standardizes features by scaling to unit variance and/or removing the mean using column summary statistics on the samples in the training set. This is a very common pre-processing step.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, RBF kernel of Support Vector Machines or the L1 and L2 regularized linear models typically work better when all features have unit variance and/or zero mean.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Standardization can improve the convergence rate during the optimization process, and also prevents against features with very large variances exerting an overly large influence during model training.  \n",
    "## Model Fitting\n",
    "StandardScaler has the following parameters in the constructor:  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* withMean False by default. Centers the data with mean before scaling. It will build a dense output, so this does not work on sparse input and will raise an exception.\n",
    "* withStd True by default. Scales the data to unit standard deviation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We provide a fit method in StandardScaler which can take an input of RDD[Vector], learn the summary statistics, and then return a model which can transform the input dataset into unit standard deviation and/or zero mean features depending how we configure the StandardScaler.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This model implements VectorTransformer which can apply the standardization on a Vector to produce a transformed Vector or on an RDD[Vector] to produce a transformed RDD[Vector].  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if the variance of a feature is zero, it will return default 0.0 value in the Vector for that feature.\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "The example below demonstrates how to load a dataset in libsvm format, and standardize the features so that the new features have unit standard deviation and/or zero mean."
