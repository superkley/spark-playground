    "1. We'll first introduce Spark both in batch mode and streaming in [Part 1: Spark Datasets and Structured Streaming](Part_1_Spark_Datasets_and_Structured_Streaming.ipynb).\n",
    "1. Second, we'll do a deep dive into [Part 2: Spark Structured Streaming](Part_2_Spark_Structured_Streaming.ipynb) exploring the API.\n",
    "1. Next, we'll go under the hood, looking at different improvements, and comparing Spark and Spark Streaming in [Part 3: DStream Comparison](Part_3_DStream_Comparison.ipynb).\n",
    "1. Finally, we'll look at how to build [Part 4: Standalone Spark Streaming Applications](Part_4_Standalone_Spark_Streaming_Applications.ipynb)\n",
