    "\n",
    "1. We will primarily be demonstrating the \"REPL\" method.  You can access the repl method by running any of the code cells in these notebooks or by running `spark-shell` from the bash command line.  Notebooks are great for didactic, exploratory, and presentation purposes.  The shell is also great for exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You can also write Spark jobs as a program to be packaged up and run as a standalone jar application.  This requires using build tools (e.g. SBT) and a reasonable amount of overhead.  We'll explore how to do this in the final notebook.  This is great for production code.\n",
    "\n",
    "For (2), you'll need to create your own `SparkContext` and `SparkSession`.  In (1), these are provided as global variables named `sc` and `spark`.  You'll access Spark functionality through these two objects."

The first is with optional fields, which will simply be `None` if no value is provided.  The second is by catching errors in a `try` `catch` pair, which simply returns nothing rather than allowing the program to crash.\n",

Notice that we need a `net.liftweb` dependency for json parsing and `org.apache.spark` dependencies for Spark.\n",
    "- The [assembly.sbt](/edit/meetup/assembly.sbt) gives assembly extra instructions on how to build a \"fat jar\", a jar that contains both the byte-code for the package you wrote and the byte-code for the packages you deploy.  This is what enables Spark to deploy easily across multiple computers.\n",
